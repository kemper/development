# A Virtual Machine for Development

## Introduction

This sets up a development environment with common development tool and a dotfiles project.

This is mostly geared towards ruby development. But it's more generally going to be my virtualized dev environment in a box for whatever I might want to work on.

## Requirements

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)

## License
